## My process

I started with the html first to get good content layout, then I went on to styling with a mobile first approach and then the desktop and later added the small interactivity of submitting by Javascript (pure JS).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla JS
